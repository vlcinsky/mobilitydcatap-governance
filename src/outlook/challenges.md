# Challenges and Future

In merging the discussions on governance and maintenance from the mobilityDCAT-AP extension, several critical considerations emerge, paving the way for addressing challenges and envisioning the future trajectory of the standard.

This includes that the **Issue Handling** is described in greater detail and the maintainers group is clearly identified.
Potential questions for issue tracking to be addressed are:

- Is there any first response to an issue?
- Is somebody preprocessing the issue, dispatching it towards specific maintainers?
- Is there a prepared resolution of the issue before the meeting?
- Is there some core maintainers group and some larger group for e.g. major fixes?

Another strategic challenge might be **under which Organisational Umbrella** the maintenance should happen in the future.
In contrast to (time-limited) projects like NAPCORE, it might be better to look at long-lasting structures, for example at the SEMIC/DCAT-AP umbrella (as already done for geoDCAT-AP and some other extensions).
However, such an organisational setup would have major implications, so further analyses and talks are needed with the EC, SEMIC and the NAP community.

Also, the **Community Engagement and Sustainability** are essential for the success of this extension.
Alike to experiences encountered with GeoDCAT-AP, sustaining active participation from maintainers poses a significant challenge.
Addressing this necessitates devising strategies to foster ongoing engagement and mitigate attrition, ensuring continuity in efforts and investments over time.

Another challenge to consider will be **Interoperability and Standard Compliance**.
The evolving landscape of regulatory frameworks, such as the ITS Delegated Regulations, underscores the importance of interoperability for mobilityDCAT-AP.
Anticipating challenges arising from revisions to regulations or updates to the DCAT-AP standard itself is essential for maintaining alignment and compatibility.

Finally, the **Adoption and Implementation Barriers** challenge should also be considered.
Perceived costs and efforts associated with adoption may deter Member States and organizations from embracing mobilityDCAT-AP.
Overcoming these barriers requires proactive measures to demonstrate the value proposition and streamline implementation processes, thereby preventing the standard from being sidelined.

Altogether, further details on maintenance and governance will be elaborated at a later stage, looking for a successful future of mobilityDCAT-AP.
