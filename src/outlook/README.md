# Outlook

The presented concept intends to establish maintenance and governance structures supporting mobilityDCAT-AP, in order to make it more sustainable and efficient in a long run.
This is true both for the maintenance of the metadata model itself, and the accompanying Controlled Vocabularies.

This concept is related to a very early stage of mobilityDCAT-AP.
The related SWG in NAPCORE has invested much of its resources into the mobilityDCAT-AP conceptualisation, its initial public release in October 2023, and support actions for early adopters.
In contrast, a proper maintenance and governance routine has not been established yet, including several update cycles or similar.
Thus, this report presents a rather pragmatic and low-tech approach for maintenance and governance, by defining some basic tools and processes for short-term maintenance and governance (within the NAPCORE runtime)

Thus, the concept needs to be concretised, whenever mobilityDCAT-AP is handed over to a follow-up organization.
In this scenario, administrative, management and technical tasks related to maintenance and governance need to be further bundled and institutionalised.
In other words, a proper mobilityDCAT-AP maintenance organization needs to be established with pre-defined tasks and resources.
