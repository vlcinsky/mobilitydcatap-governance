# The DCAT-AP reference

DCAT-AP[^1] is a DCAT profile for sharing information about Catalogues
containing Datasets and Data Services descriptions in Europe, under
maintenance by the SEMIC action, Interoperable Europe[^2].

Interoperable Europe, within its mission to stimulate data interoperability in Europe, manages this specification on the metadata agreements for sharing dataset descriptions between data portals.
The governance is taken care of by the SEMIC action within Interoperable Europe.
Initially, the scope of the specification was the exchange between Open Data Portals in Europe.
Although this is still at the core of the specification, DCAT-AP is not limited to public accessible Open Data but can be applied to any kind of datasets.
In the past decade, DCAT-AP has grown from a single specification to a whole ecosystem of related and interconnected specifications.

Based on DCAT-AP, there are several extensions available for various sectors, for example, the geoDCAT-AP for the geodata sector.
Within the NAPCORE SWG4.4, there is made a new extension for the mobility sector, called mobilityDCAT-AP.

In October 2023 the first version of mobilityDCAT-AP was launched[^3].
Hereafter, there is a need for a concept about Governance and Maintenance.

As far as possible, the same approach is used for the governance and maintenance as in the overarching working method of DCAT-AP.
The DCAT-AP approach is published under the "Change and Release Management Policy for DCAT-AP"[^4].
This represents a standardised approach to achieve a consistent European-level methodology for the management of DCAT-AP implementations and is applied as the main reference for this concept, as explained next.
