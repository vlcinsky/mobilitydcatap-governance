# Release cycle of mobilityDCAT-AP

3 different types of changes are foreseen:

- Bugfixes
- Minor semantic changes
- Major semantic changes

**Bugfixes** are corrections of errors or consistencies in the specification.
These will not affect the operability of mobilityDCAT-AP.
Bugfixes will be published in a six-month schedule if they are not combined with other types of release.
For example, every October and April.

**Minor semantic changes** are changes that may affect the interoperability, but only in a non-disruptive way.
Examples are the addition of optional properties or 'deprecation of unused, optional properties.
These changes will be published on a yearly schedule.
For example, every October.

**Major semantic changes** are changes that have (more) serious consequences for interoperability, for example, the addition of mandatory properties or the mandatory controlled vocabulary.
Changes will be published every two years.
