# Issue handling

Issue handling is considered part of the ongoing efforts of the NAPCORE Metadata Group (SWG 4.4) to establish and curate the new metadata specification mobilityDCAT-AP.
There is an extra work item and milestone related to this, with the working title "napDCAT-AP[^5] Back Office".
Thus, during the project lifetime of NAPCORE, SWG4.4 will take care of the issues on mobilityDCAT-AP, which are managed by different repositories established by SWG 4.4.

On the other side, issue handling as part of a follow-up of NAPCORE needs to be further concretised in the future, see Chapter 3.

Issues can be questions, problems encountered or remarks about former mobilityDCAT-AP releases; or proposals for changes or new functionalities for future releases.
Such changes might be additions, changes or removals of definitions in the mobiltyDCAT-AP data model (including vocabulary terms, ranges, cardinalities and usage notes).
There might be also changes in overarching topics, such as generic management structures.

Any issues can be submitted as issues on the mobilityDCAT-AP repository on GitHub[^6], including issues for the Controlled Vocabularies[^7].
Issues that touch on model elements derived from the DCAT-AP model will be forwarded to the DCAT-AP working group.

It is noted that DCAT-AP has established various roles for the maintenance: among others, there is a "management team", "operational team", and "working group".
However, under the current set-up of SWG 4.4., there is no such separation of maintainers.
I.e., any active SWG member can propose, manage and moderate any issue.
Further, interested parties outside the SWG will be invited to collaborate via GitHub and discuss relevant issues with the SWG.

It is agreed that current issues are regularly discussed at SWG meetings.
Such meeting will be held every two months.
Part of the agenda will be a discussion on the issue backlog.
If a submitter of the issue is outside the SWG, he or she will be invited to the sub-working group\'s meeting to discuss the solution.

For each issue, the submitter of the issue or a SWG member may propose a resolution.
The SWG will then decide to accept a proposal, deny it, or direct it for further discussion.
The acceptance might also include conditions, e.g. "accepted for next minor release / major release ...".

Any resolution will imply a decision to be made in the sub-working group.
In general, a consensus is sought for such decisions.

Similar to processes at DCAT-AP and geoDCAT-AP, concensus-building is organised depending on the impact of the related resolutions:

- Minor resolutions with a lower impact will be proposed by SGW 4.4. members in advance of a SWG meeting.
  They will be considered accepted when there is no opposition at the latest 2 weeks after the SWG 4.4 meeting, where the issue was presented.
- Major resolutions might involve a voting procedure.
  Depending on the severity, the voting might be done during the SWG 4.4 meeting.
  The meeting leader will explain the voting options and let participants vote instantly.
  To reach a consensus, a two-thirds majority of the participants in the meeting is required.
  In more severe cases, a more formal voting involving Member States (representing the NAPCORE community) is required.
  In such cases, each Member State gets one vote, regardless of the number of participants from that Member State.

Decisions are documented on the GitHub repository, where also the issues are managed.
