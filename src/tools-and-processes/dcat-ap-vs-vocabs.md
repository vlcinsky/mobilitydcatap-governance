# Maintenance of mobiltyDCAT-AP vs. Controlled Vocabularies

SWG 4.4 elaborates two independent products:

- The mobilityDCAT-AP specification as such
- A set of Controlled Vocabularies (which are cited by the mobilityDCAT-AP specification)

Both products are handled by separate GitHub repositories, as explained above.
It is agreed that, in terms of issue tracking and versioning, these two products will remain independent, meaning that mobilityDCAT-AP and the Controlled Vocabularies can be updated independently.
However, the procedures for maintenance, issue tracking, resolutions etc. can be the same.

The reason is that there might be a different pace of evolution for mobilityDCAT-AP vs. the Controlled Vocabularies.
Keeping both independent has the following benefits:

- We can do updates of the Controlled Vocabularies, without \"waiting\" for updates of mobilityDCAT-AP, or vice versa.
- Users have the freedom to deploy ANY version of mobilityDCAT-AP in combination with ANY version of the Controlled Vocabularies.
