# Introduction

This report presents a concept for governance and maintenance structures for the mobilityDCAT-AP metadata specification.
It imposes the formalities, tools and methods for taking care of the future progress of mobilityDCAT-AP.
The concept is based on best practices on governance and maintenance in other metadata specifications, in particular DCAT-AP.
The concept addresses the following questions:

- What organisational and technical structure should be established? (e.g., who are the maintainers?; what is the technical solution for issue tracking?)
- How to receive, store and process incoming issues and comments about mobilityDCAT-AP?
- What are the workflows to discuss and approve resolutions?
